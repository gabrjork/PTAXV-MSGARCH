# PTAXV-MSGARCH
a brief study regarding the behaviour of BRL during strenghtning and weakening periods using a Markov-Switching GARCH

this repository contains the R script I used to estimate the MSGARCH that suggested that the BRL depreciates 
in a sharp volatile state, while it gains value in a much more stable one

the script gathers data from central banks' sgs using GetBCBData. 
the estimation used the MSGARCH package
